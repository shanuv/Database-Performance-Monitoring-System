# Database-Performance-Monitoring-System
Course project for 'Principles of Database Systems'

Monitoring of a Database includes measurement of the performance in terms of internal and OS-level
statistics (CPU, RAM, Disk, cache). This may be used in order to determine problems in the database
and find corresponding solutions as well as measure the query optimization techniques. In this project
we aim to design a visual interface displaying the real-time statistics and potentially detecting resource
saturation. We would display periodic snapshots as well as aim to track performance trends. Evaluation
based on the monitored database performance has been used to ”minimize response time and maximize
throughput, yielding optimal performance”.
